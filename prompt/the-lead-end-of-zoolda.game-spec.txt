I'm envisioning a 2D platformer game with a top-down perspective, reminiscent of classic Zelda and Hydelide titles. Please help me outline the game's core mechanics and features:

Gameplay:

Overhead View: The game world is presented from a top-down perspective, giving players a clear view of their surroundings.
Exploration and Combat: Players will navigate through a series of interconnected levels, encountering enemies and obstacles along the way. Combat will involve using a variety of weapons and abilities to defeat foes.
Leveling and Progression: As players gain experience by defeating enemies and completing objectives, they will level up and become more powerful. This could involve increased health, new abilities, or access to stronger weapons.
Procedural Generation: Levels, enemies, and rewards will be procedurally generated, ensuring that each playthrough offers a unique and challenging experience.
Playable Levels: The level generation algorithms should prioritize creating levels that are both engaging and fair, with clear paths, interesting challenges, and balanced enemy placement.
Technical Considerations:

2D Tile-Based Engine: The game will likely utilize a 2D tile-based engine for level construction and rendering.
Possible Engine Choices: Consider popular options like Unity with 2D tilemap support, GameMaker Studio 2, or Godot Engine.
Alternative: Explore the possibility of using a 3D engine like Three.js to create a 2.5D aesthetic, where 3D models are used but gameplay remains on a 2D plane.
Additional Features (Optional):

Puzzles and Secrets: Include environmental puzzles or hidden areas to encourage exploration and reward curious players.
Boss Battles: Conclude certain levels or areas with challenging boss encounters that test the player's skills and abilities.
Inventory System: Allow players to collect and manage a variety of items, including weapons, health potions, and keys.
Please provide a detailed breakdown of the following aspects:

Core Gameplay Loop: How will players interact with the game world, progress through levels, and overcome challenges?
Procedural Generation: What specific algorithms or techniques will be used to generate levels, enemies, and rewards? How will the game ensure that generated content is balanced and playable?
Technical Implementation: Which game engine or framework would be best suited for this project? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each option?
Feel free to expand on these points and suggest additional features or mechanics that would enhance the overall gameplay experience.

Let's work together to refine this concept and create a compelling game design document!
